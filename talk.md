# Talk Overview

.large[
* .bold[Time]: 20 minutes talk + 10 minutes questions
* .bold[Notes from organizers]:
   - Slides can just advertise/summarize available "features" at various facilities that could be useful for AGC style workflows.
      - Example: UChicago we have now also Triton supporting 70 GPUs
   - It would be ideal to test them also
   - Nice example to test if AGC notebook can run all the way, and if not what is missing.

# Analysis Facilities

<br>
.large[
.center.huge.bold[What is an Analysis Facility?]

Taking the [HSF Analysis Facilities Forum](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/analysisfacilitiesforum.html)'s definition:

.italic[The .bold[infrastructure and services] that provide .bold[integrated data, software and computational resources] to execute one or more elements of an analysis workflow. These resources are .bold[shared] among members of a virtual organization and .bold[supported by that organization].]

<br>
We also had lots of discussion about this at the [2020 Future Analysis Systems and Facilities IRIS-HEP Blueprint workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/960587/).

<br>
Already covered this today in AGC [German facilities](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/timetable/?view=standard#18-experience-with-agc-at-germ) (David Koch) and [US CMS Analysis Facilities](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1260431/timetable/?view=standard#19-agc-at-us-cms-afs) (Carl Lundstedt) talks.
